# Machine-Learning-Wine-Quality-Random-Forest
The objective is to use a different model, in this case, random forest, to make prediction for quality of wine. In addition, instead of predicting the quality of wine as a numerical value, I simply categorize wine into 2 different groups (0 and 1) using the lambda function. 

0 = low quality wine
1 = high quality wine

Any wine with score above or equal to 7 will be mapped to 1 while the anything below 7 will be categorized as 0.
