# Machine-Learning-Wine-Quality-Random-Forest
The objective is to use a different model, in this case, random forest, to make prediction for quality of wine. In addition, instead of predicting the quality of wine as a numerical value, simply categorize wine into 2 different groups using the lambda function.
